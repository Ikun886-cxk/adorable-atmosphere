Father Wu Tianfa chewed on a chicken leg, glanced at his son's male genitalia, and nonchalantly poured himself a drink, raising his head to finish it in one gulp. Mother Chen Wangshi, on the other hand, didn't expect her son's male genitalia to have developed so maturely and turned her face away in embarrassment.

Master Acai raised his hand, grasped Wu Huowang's penis, and slowly retracted the foreskin, exposing the glans. The glans, a dark pink fleshy mass, plump and swollen at the tip of the penis. Master Acai pinched the glans of Wu Huowang with his index finger and thumb, opening the urethral opening to reveal a hole.

The originally oval-shaped glans transformed into an elongated shape, and looking into the open urethral opening, one could see the deep red flesh wall inside. Master Acai stretched his neck, brought his face closer, and carefully observed Wu Huowang's urethral opening.

Using his fingers to hold Wu Huowang's glans, he lifted the penis and focused attentively on observing the bottom of Wu Huowang's glans. Setting the penis down, Master Acai enclosed the glans with the foreskin once again, then pulled back the foreskin, fully exposing the glans.

Master Acai held Wu Huowang's penis, lowered his head, and brought his nose close to Wu Huowang's urethral opening, carefully taking a sniff. After sniffing for a while, Master Acai brought his nostrils close to the base of Wu Huowang's penis, along the bottom of the penis, and even stuck his nose between the penis root and scrotum, carefully smelling the scent of Wu Huowang's genitalia.

Awkwardly standing by the square table, Wu Huowang, in front of his parents, pulled down his outer and inner pants to his knees. His mother, Chen Wangshi, held both his hands firmly. With a sleeveless white linen undershirt, his lower abdomen revealed pubic hair and the prominent male genitalia. Master Acai bent his head down and buried it under Wu Huowang's crotch, sniffing the scent from his scrotum.

"Indeed, the Yang energy is insufficient," Master Acai raised his head and said to mother Chen Wangshi, "Come and take a look..."

Master Acai adjusted his posture, allowing the mature male genitalia of his son, Wu Huowang, to face the light of the kerosene lamp. He raised his left hand, scooped up Wu Huowang's scrotum, and with his right hand, felt the skin of Wu Huowang's scrotum. Using a V-shape gesture with his index and middle fingers, he stretched the scrotum skin, highlighting the elliptical contours of the testicles. "Your son's testicles are indeed large, but, oh, they're too soft!"

"Look!" Master Acai lightly caressed Wu Huowang's testicles, pinching the right testicle with his index and middle fingers, pressing down slightly. The surface of the plump testicle indented with elasticity.

Father Wu Tianfa, with food in his mouth, couldn't help but raise his head and take a look. Mother Chen Wangshi lowered her head, staring at her son's developed testicles, and anxiously said, "What should we do now?"

Bending down, Chen Wangshi looked at her son Wu Huowang's testicles, worriedly asking, "Is there any medicine to cure this?"

"Medicine won't be effective; his Yang energy is too weak," Master Acai furrowed his brow, holding Wu Huowang's testicles. Together with Chen Wangshi, he lowered his head to study the testicles.

Master Acai carefully looked at Wu Huowang's scrotum in the palm of his left hand, occasionally using his right hand to smooth the scrotum skin, and gently pinching the testicles between his index and middle fingers.

After a while, Master Acai raised his head, stroked his chin with his grey-white long beard, and solemnly said, "If things continue like this, even in another ten years, he won't be able to produce offspring!"

"This won't do! Master Acai! Please!" Chen Wangshi became anxious and pleaded, "In our Wu family, it's been three generations without an heir! We only have Awang as our son. If he can't have children, our family line will end!"

"The most important thing is to supplement the Yang energy. I will prescribe medicine for you, so you need not worry," Master Acai said.

Putting down Wu Huowang's scrotum, he took out a white handkerchief from the pocket of his grey robe and wiped his hands. 

"However..." Master Acai fell into contemplation, his expression turning gloomy. "Taking medicine is just a supplement; it can't address the root cause."

Wu Huowang had already pulled up his black pants. His mother, Chen Wangshi, held his strong arm and anxiously said to Master Acai, "Please, Master Acai, how can we save him?"

Chen Wangshi spoke in a panic, "Otherwise, we won't have grandchildren. I have let down our Wu family ancestors!"
