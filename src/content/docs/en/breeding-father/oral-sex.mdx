In the outer hall of the low adobe house, beneath the shrine table adorned with black clay statues, at the end of the wooden square table, Mother Chen Wǎngshì's face, filled with shyness, turned towards the wall but couldn't help stealing glances. On the floor behind Chen Wǎngshì, son Wú Huǒwàng knelt, exposing his buttocks, while Father Wú Tiánfā stood behind his son's buttocks, trousers lowered to the knees, revealing a flaccid penis. Ācái-shī squatted between his legs, lifting his head to lick his scrotum.

Father Wú Tiánfā, wearing a sleeveless white linen vest, stood with his strong, dark arms crossed, tilting his head in a proud manner. His restless eyes closed, and his waist slightly thrust forward, causing his genitals to protrude. 

Ācái-shī licked from Wú Tiánfā's scrotum to his buttocks, then back to the scrotum, and further up to the penis, licking along the coronal groove until the glans was enveloped in his mouth.

However, despite Ācái-shī's extensive licking of Wú Tiánfā's penis, there was no response, and it remained limp as usual.

Wú Tiánfā's grayish-white crew cut and dark forehead were reflected in the glow of two red candles on the altar. He had a slight sheen of sweat, furrowed brows, gritted teeth, and sweat glistening on his short beard. Beneath his reddened neck, exposed by the unbuttoned linen vest, his dark chest was revealed.

Wú Tiánfā seemed to be making a determined effort to achieve an erection, but no matter how Ācái-shī licked between his thighs, his penis remained flaccid.

Facing away from her husband Wú Tiánfā, Chen Wǎngshì caught a glimpse out of the corner of her eye and couldn't resist turning around to curse aloud, 'You useless old man! You're good for nothing!'

"You..." Wú Tiánfā opened his eyes, a mix of shame and anger, and raised his hand as if to strike, "...shut up!"

"You!" Chen Wǎngshì, with sharp teeth, was about to retort when their son Wú Huǒwàng intervened.

"Don't argue!" Wú Huǒwàng, on all fours like a dog, knelt down and raised his head to mediate. "Mother, stop nagging at Father all the time!"

"Raising you as my son was in vain!" Chen Wǎngshì bent over angrily, jabbing her finger forcefully at Wú Huǒwàng's forehead. "It's all about protecting your old man! If it weren't for me, you wouldn't even exist!"

"Enough, enough!" Ācái-shī released Father Wú Tiánfā's limp penis from his mouth and turned to say, "Āwàng-zǎi, come over and help."

Upon hearing this, Wú Huǒwàng turned his head to look at Ācái-shī. The latter gestured for Wú Huǒwàng to come, and Wú Huǒwàng climbed to his feet, stooping down to pull up his pants from around his ankles.

"No need to wear pants!" Ācái-shī extended his hand to stop Wú Huǒwàng and signaled for him to lift his foot.

 He then removed Wú Huǒwàng's black cloth pants, along with the white linen underwear, and placed them on a long stool. He also took off Wú Huǒwàng's black cloth kung fu shoes and white socks.

Underneath Wú Huǒwàng's sturdy abdomen, his flaccid penis hung between his bare legs.

"Squat here," Ācái-shī stood up from in front of Father Wú Tiánfā's feet and adjusted his position, giving way to his son Wú Huǒwàng.

Wú Huǒwàng hesitated, glancing at Mother Chen Wǎngshì, then followed the instructions and squatted in front of Father Wú Tiánfā's feet.

"Mouth open, stick out your tongue," Ācái-shī instructed, while his right hand grasped Father Wú Tiánfā's limp penis and guided it towards the open mouth of his son Wú Huǒwàng.

Father Wú Tiánfā, with an embarrassed face, had both hands on his hips, and his waist thrust in the direction of his penis being pulled, extending it towards the mouth of his son Wú Huǒwàng.

"That's it! Like that, suck. Can you do it?" Ācái-shī used his right hand to guide Father Wú Tiánfā's penis into the open mouth of his son Wú Huǒwàng, while his left hand supported the son's chin, closing his mouth.

"Yes, like that, suck," Ācái-shī carefully instructed, then stepped over to the side of Father Wú Tiánfā and reached out to untie his white linen vest.
