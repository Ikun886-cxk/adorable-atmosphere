"In fact, it's really simple," Mr. Cai laughed as he turned around, walking over to the side table and placing the medicine box on it. Standing in front of Wu Tianfa, he said, "But first, we need to check if you're suitable. If it's not too much trouble, please stand up."

In Chenwang City, in the quiet embrace of his son Wu Huowang, Wu Tianfa sobbed while watching his stunned son.

Wu Tianfa cleared his throat and nonchalantly stood up, pulling down the hem of his loose white linen robe with his strong, dark hands. His tongue was still picking food residue from between his teeth.

"How impolite!" Mr. Cai bowed slightly, gesturing towards Wu Tianfa. He then extended his hand, lifting up the hem of Wu Tianfa's robe to reveal his abdomen. Underneath the slightly protruding, dark and abundant belly, thick black abdominal hair sprouted.

"Your son has so much hair here," Mr. Cai said, stroking the black hair on Wu Tianfa's abdomen. He turned to Chenwang City and said, "It seems his yang energy is quite abundant. I'll examine it more closely."

After finishing his sentence, Mr. Cai grabbed the elastic band of Wu Tianfa's black cloth pants and pulled it down, along with the white linen underwear, until it reached his knees, fully exposing Wu Tianfa's male genitalia.

The short and thick dark brown glans protruded from the dense black hair. The penis stood erect, supported by the full scrotum underneath. The dark glans of the penis was adorned with deep blue and purple veins, curving at a fifteen-degree angle from below the abdomen. Wu Tianfa's glans, swollen and round, revealed itself at the top of the coronal groove, with the foreskin retracted beneath the base of the glans. The scrotum, wrinkled and dark brown, nestled between the sturdy thighs.

"Not bad!" Mr. Cai exclaimed. He slightly bent forward, carefully examining Wu Tianfa's penis. Mr. Cai extended his right hand, using two fingers to pinch and lift Wu Tianfa's penis, while his left hand cupped Wu Tianfa's scrotum, inspecting it closely.

Mr. Cai brought his nose close to Wu Tianfa's scrotum, sniffing carefully. After a while, he raised his head and observed Wu Tianfa's scrotum with great concentration. Then, he used the index and middle fingers of his right hand to pinch Wu Tianfa's testicles, pressing them down.

"Your father's testicles are quite firm," Mr. Cai turned to his son, Wu Huowang, and said, "Come here!"

Wu Huowang glanced at his mother, Chenwang City, then pulled down the hem of his white linen robe and walked over to Mr. Cai's side.

Mr. Cai said to Wu Huowang, "Take off your pants!"

Wu Huowang turned his head to look at Chenwang City, who was tearfully watching him. He hesitated for a moment, then used both hands to grab the elastic band of his black cloth pants, bending over and lowering his head. He pulled down the pants and underwear to his knees, fully exposing his male genitalia. 

Standing in front of the father-son duo, Mr. Cai used his left hand to touch Wu Tianfa's testicles, while reaching under Wu Huowang's crotch with his right hand to caress his testicles, simultaneously examining the testicles of both father and son. He lowered his head in contemplation.

Mr. Cai used his left index finger and thumb to grip Wu Tianfa's testicles, feeling their size and weight. At the same time, he used his right index finger and thumb to pinch Wu Huowang's testicles, testing their elasticity.

"Let's give it a try," Mr. Cai announced the verdict-like decision, "Father's yang energy will now flow into his son, replenishing his yang energy!"

After the announcement, Mr. Cai released his grip, straightened up, and took out a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his hands. Wu Tianfa and Wu Huowang, father and son, with their pants down to their knees and their male genitalia fully exposed, looked at each other, unsure of what to do.
